I wrote an HTML page that follow what was going on on the page assignment

It wasn't too difficult except learning the image tag.

I fisrt started with the headings and the followed the paragraphs about just somethings that popped in my head and afterwards did the list and then finished with the image tag, which i will admit was tricky but in the end i figured it out and am happy with it
