    <h1>Welcome to My First Page</h1>
    <p>This is the html page I've ever actually built myself for this class at least. I have built a couple pages before but just for fun because well why not right.</p>

    <h2>The Page</h2>
    <p>This page is about no specific thing that I am writing about, it's just a general page about stuffs and my writing will be randomly written words, basically whatever is off the top of my head.</p>

    <img src="HTML5_Logo_128.png" alt="A HTML5 image" width="200" height="200">

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/">HTML5 Logo</a></p>

    <p>This is the HTML5 logo that is was talking about, pretty cool, eh.</p>

<p>This is the last paragraph of this page. Next is a table with two columns and you'll see a list of some random things not neccessarily related things.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Colunm 1</th>
            <th>Colunm 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item 1</td>
            <td>Item 3</td>
            <td>Item 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item 2</td>
            <td>Item 4</td>
            <td>Item 6</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
